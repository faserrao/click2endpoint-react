# Click2Endpoint Project Structure Clarification

## Directory Structure
The Click2Endpoint project has two separate implementations in sibling directories:

```
/Users/frankserrao/Dropbox/Customers/c2m/projects/c2m-api/C2M_API_v2/click2endpoint/
├── c2m-api-v2-click2endpoint/     (Streamlit version - original)
└── click2endpoint-react/          (React version - current/active)
```

## Key Points

### No Conflicts
1. **They're separate repos** - Each has its own Git repository, so no Git conflicts
2. **Different directories** - No file conflicts between the two versions
3. **Different ports** - Streamlit (8502) vs React (5173), so they can even run simultaneously
4. **Clear separation** - The React version is the active one going forward

### Current Status
- **Streamlit version** (`c2m-api-v2-click2endpoint/`): Original implementation, has uncommitted UI changes from Sept 29 session
- **React version** (`click2endpoint-react/`): Active implementation, pushed to GitHub at https://github.com/faserrao/click2endpoint-react

### Minor Issues
The only minor issue is that we modified files in the old Streamlit version that won't be used. Options:
1. **Keep the changes** as a reference (the black/white theme could be ported to React later if desired)
2. **Revert the changes** with `git checkout -- streamlit_app/app_hardcoded_v1.py` to keep the Streamlit version in its original state
3. **Archive it** since the React version is the active one

### Notes
- The `click2endpoint-react.zip` file in the Streamlit directory is probably just a backup/export and can be ignored or deleted since the actual React code is in the sibling directory
- No conflicts or problems will occur - the two versions can coexist peacefully
- Each version maintains its own Git history and can be developed independently if needed

## Recommendation
Focus all future development on the React version at `../click2endpoint-react/` as it is the active implementation.
