# Session Log: Dynamic Mock Server Integration
Date: 2025-09-30

## Overview
Implemented dynamic mock server selection in Click2Endpoint React app, matching functionality from the Streamlit version.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Postman API Service
- File: `src/services/postmanApi.ts`
- Fetches collections and mock servers from Postman API
- Supports personal and team workspace switching
- Falls back to default mock server if no API key available

### 2. Added Mock Server Selector Component
- File: `src/components/MockServerSelector.tsx`
- Allows switching between personal/team workspaces
- Displays available mock servers with collection names
- Shows selected mock server URL

### 3. Environment Variables
- Created `.env.example` with required variables:
  - `VITE_POSTMAN_API_KEY_PERSONAL`
  - `VITE_POSTMAN_API_KEY_TEAM`
  - `VITE_DEFAULT_MOCK_URL`
  - `VITE_AUTH_BASE_URL`
- Updated code generators to use environment variables

### 4. UI Integration
- Added MockServerSelector to welcome screen
- Pass selected mock server URL through component chain
- Code generators now use dynamically selected mock server

## Key Findings

### API Keys Not Required for Production
- Postman API keys only needed to discover/list mock servers
- Mock servers themselves don't require authentication
- Can hardcode mock server URLs for production deployment

### Authentication Requirements
- Client ID/Secret still needed for C2M auth server
- Currently using test credentials in generated code
- May need UI for users to input their own credentials

## Next Steps
- Consider adding UI for client credential input
- Potentially remove Postman API dependency for production
- Could pre-configure available mock servers

## Technical Notes
- Mock servers are publicly accessible by default
- Generated code includes C2M auth flow
- Falls back gracefully when no API keys present
